                <h3>Gym</h3>
                <p>Regular training at the gym with a focus on strength and endurance has become a key part of my routine. It not only helps me stay fit and healthy but also strengthens my discipline and determination. I enjoy setting goals and pushing myself to reach them, and the progress I see over time keeps me motivated. The gym is also a great way to clear my mind and reduce stress.</p><br>

                <h3>Coding</h3>
                <p>I'm passionate about programming â€” it's something that has fascinated me since I was a child. I started exploring computers at around 6 or 7 years old, playing with Paint and secretly navigating beyond it to see what else Windows could do. Programming lets me turn ideas into real, working projects, which I find incredibly exciting. It challenges my problem-solving skills and creativity, and there's always something new to learn. I love the feeling of finally solving a bug or building something that actually works.</p>
